## Clean Code 

Clean Code. Follows PEP-8, uses descriptive object names, appropriate comments, general and reproducible objects, functions accomplish a clear task etc


- Comment more in your cells. This will help you (in the future) and the reader understand your process. 
- Code appeared to be scattered in some areas. Jupyter notebooks can be cluttered and difficult to organize.
  For future projects, consider creating function to automate your cleaning and EDA process. By creating functions this will clean up yout Jupyter notebook workspace.
- Very good job using GeoPy package to conduct analysis and create visuals. 

## Good Documentation

 Markdown explains work and defines sections, visualizations are easy to read and they relate to content, thought process is clear, etc.

- Markdown file is clear and concise. 
- Readme grabbed my attention and was easy to follow and understand. This is great for technical and non-technical audiences.
- Consider making the bulleted items black instead of the faint gray. Can be hard to read. 
- Consistent scales for x and y-axis, Top 20 Busiest Stations doesn't have an x or y axis legend.


## Proper Data Science

Models are correctly specified (e.g., no heteroskedasticity in interpreting a linear model), valid conclusions drawn from visualizations, etc

- Project 1 is focused on data exploration, cleaning, and visualization. Therefore, we are this section will be assessed on those topics.

- Conclusions presented in the slide deck were a bit difficult to draw from the code/analysis. 
  Again, I think an ordering and better explanation throughout the notebook would make it easier to understand.
